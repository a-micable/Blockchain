# Simple Blockchain
A minimal yet functional blockchain implementation written in TypeScript, designed to demystify the core concepts of decentralized ledgers. This project walks through block creation, wallet generation, transaction handling, and mining via Proof of Work — all through a clean CLI interface.

Project Overview
This project serves as a hands-on introduction to blockchain fundamentals. It's not about flashy tokens or NFTs — it's about getting your hands dirty with the actual mechanics of how a blockchain works under the hood. By implementing key features from scratch using TypeScript, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of what makes a blockchain tick.

Features
Block Creation & Management – Build and maintain a secure chain of blocks.
Transaction Handling – Create, validate, and record transactions between wallets.
Wallet Generation – Generate wallets with cryptographically secure public/private key pairs.
Proof of Work – Simulate mining using a basic PoW algorithm.
Command-Line Interface – Interact with the blockchain through a simple CLI.
